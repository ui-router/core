  /**
   * Registers a [[TransitionHookFn]], called *before a transition starts*.

   * See [[TransitionHookFn]] for the signature of the function.
   *
   * The [[HookMatchCriteria]] is used to determine which Transitions the hook should be invoked for.
   * To match all Transitions, use an empty criteria object `{}`.
   *
   * ### Lifecycle
   *
   * `onBefore` hooks are invoked *before a Transition starts*.
   * No resolves have been fetched yet.
   * Each `onBefore` hook is invoked synchronously, in the same call stack as [[StateService.transitionTo]].
   * The registered `onBefore` hooks are invoked in priority order.
   *
   * Note: during the `onBefore` phase, additional hooks can be added to the specific [[Transition]] instance.
   * These "on-the-fly" hooks only affect the currently running transition..
   *
   * ### Return value
   *
   * The hook's return value can be used to pause, cancel, or redirect the current Transition.
   * See [[HookResult]] for more information.
   *
   * If any hook modifies the transition *synchronously* (by throwing, returning `false`, or returning
   * a [[TargetState]]), the remainder of the hooks are skipped.
   * If a hook returns a promise, the remainder of the `onBefore` hooks are still invoked synchronously.
   * All promises are resolved, and processed asynchronously before the `onStart` phase of the Transition.
   *
   * ### Examples
   *
   * #### Default Substate
   *
   * This example redirects any transition from 'home' to 'home.dashboard'.  This is commonly referred to as a
   * "default substate".
   *
   * @example
   * ```js
   * // ng2
   * transitionService.onBefore({ to: 'home' }, (trans: Transition) =>
   *     trans.router.stateService.target("home.dashboard"));
   * ```
   *
   * #### Data Driven Default Substate
   *
   * This example provides data-driven default substate functionality. It matches on a transition to any state
   * which has `defaultSubstate: "some.sub.state"` defined.  See: [[Transition.to]] which returns the "to state"
   * definition.
   *
   * @example
   * ```js
   * // ng1
   * // state declaration
   * {
   *   name: 'home',
   *   template: '<div ui-view/>',
   *   defaultSubstate: 'home.dashboard'
   * }
   *
   * var criteria = {
   *   to: function(state) {
   *     return state.defaultSubstate != null;
   *   }
   * }
   *
   * $transitions.onBefore(criteria, function(trans: Transition) {
   *   var substate = trans.to().defaultSubstate;
   *   return trans.router.stateService.target(substate);
   * });
   * ```
   *
   *
   * #### Require authentication
   *
   * This example cancels a transition to a state which requires authentication, if the user is not currently authenticated.
   *
   * This example assumes a state tree where all states which require authentication are children of a parent `'requireauth'` state.
   * This example assumes `MyAuthService` synchronously returns a boolean from `isAuthenticated()`.
   *
   * @example
   * ```js
   * // ng1
   * $transitions.onBefore( { to: 'requireauth.**' }, function(trans) {
   *   var myAuthService = trans.injector().get('MyAuthService');
   *   // If isAuthenticated returns false, the transition is cancelled.
   *   return myAuthService.isAuthenticated();
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * @param matchCriteria defines which Transitions the Hook should be invoked for.
   * @param callback the hook function which will be invoked.
   * @returns a function which deregisters the hook.
   */

  /**
   * Registers a [[TransitionHookFn]], called when a transition starts.
   *
   * Registers a transition lifecycle hook, which is invoked as a transition starts running.

   *
   * See [[TransitionHookFn]] for the signature of the function.
   *
   * The [[HookMatchCriteria]] is used to determine which Transitions the hook should be invoked for.
   * To match all Transitions, use an empty criteria object `{}`.
   *
   * ### Lifecycle
   *
   * `onStart` hooks are invoked asynchronously when the Transition starts running.
   * This happens after the `onBefore` phase is complete.
   * At this point, the Transition has not yet exited nor entered any states.
   * The registered `onStart` hooks are invoked in priority order.
   *
   * Note: A built-in `onStart` hook with high priority is used to fetch any eager resolve data.
   *
   * ### Return value
   *
   * The hook's return value can be used to pause, cancel, or redirect the current Transition.
   * See [[HookResult]] for more information.
   *
   * ### Example
   *
   * #### Login during transition
   *
   * This example intercepts any transition to a state which requires authentication, when the user is
   * not currently authenticated.  It allows the user to authenticate asynchronously, then resumes the
   * transition.  If the user did not authenticate successfully, it redirects to the "guest" state, which
   * does not require authentication.
   *
   * This example assumes:
   * - a state tree where all states which require authentication are children of a parent `'auth'` state.
   * - `MyAuthService.isAuthenticated()` synchronously returns a boolean.
   * - `MyAuthService.authenticate()` presents a login dialog, and returns a promise which is resolved
   *   or rejected, whether or not the login attempt was successful.
   *
   * @example
   * ```js
   * // ng1
   * $transitions.onStart( { to: 'auth.**' }, function(trans) {
   *   var $state = trans.router.stateService;
   *   var MyAuthService = trans.injector().get('MyAuthService');
   *
   *   // If the user is not authenticated
   *   if (!MyAuthService.isAuthenticated()) {
   *
   *     // Then return a promise for a successful login.
   *     // The transition will wait for this promise to settle
   *
   *     return MyAuthService.authenticate().catch(function() {
   *
   *       // If the authenticate() method failed for whatever reason,
   *       // redirect to a 'guest' state which doesn't require auth.
   *       return $state.target("guest");
   *     });
   *   }
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * @param matchCriteria defines which Transitions the Hook should be invoked for.
   * @param callback the hook function which will be injected and invoked.

   *

   *

   * directly on a state declaration (see: [[StateDeclaration.onEnter]]).
   * 
   *
   * ### Examples
   *
   * #### Audit Log
   *
   * This example uses a service to log that a user has entered the admin section of an app.
   * This assumes that there are substates of the "admin" state, such as "admin.users", "admin.pages", etc.
   * @example
   * ```
   *
   * $transitions.onEnter({ entering: 'admin' }, function(transition, state) {
   *   var AuditService = trans.injector().get('AuditService');
   *   AuditService.log("Entered " + state.name + " module while transitioning to " + transition.to().name);
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * #### Audit Log (inside a state declaration)
   *
   * The `onEnter` inside this state declaration is syntactic sugar for the previous Audit Log example.
   * ```
   * {
   *   name: 'admin',
   *   component: 'admin',
   *   onEnter: function($transition$, $state$) {
   *     var AuditService = $transition$.injector().get('AuditService');
   *     AuditService.log("Entered " + state.name + " module while transitioning to " + transition.to().name);

   * - A Transition Hook returned a rejected promise
   * - A resolve function returned a rejected promise

   *
   * @param matchCriteria defines which Transitions the Hook should be invoked for.
   * @param callback the hook function which will be injected and invoked.
   * @returns a function which deregisters the hook.

/**
 * This object is used to configure whether or not a Transition Hook is invoked for a particular transition,
 * based on the Transition's "to state" and "from state".
 *
 * Each property (`to`, `from`, `exiting`, `retained`, and `entering`) can be a state [[Glob]] string,
 * a boolean, or a function that takes a state and returns a boolean (see [[HookMatchCriterion]])
 *
 * All properties are optional.  If any property is omitted, it is replaced with the value `true`, and always matches.
 * To match any transition, use an empty criteria object `{}`.
 *
 * #### Example:
 * ```js
 * // This matches a transition coming from the `parent` state and going to the `parent.child` state.
 * var match = {
 *   to: 'parent',
 *   from: 'parent.child'
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### Example:
 * ```js
 * // This matches a transition coming from any substate of `parent` and going directly to the `parent` state.
 * var match = {
 *   to: 'parent',
 *   from: 'parent.**'
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### Example:
 * ```js
 * // This matches a transition coming from any state and going to any substate of `mymodule`
 * var match = {
 *   to: 'mymodule.**'
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### Example:
 * ```js
 * // This matches a transition coming from any state and going to any state that has `data.authRequired`
 * // set to a truthy value.
 * var match = {
 *   to: function(state) {
 *     return state.data != null && state.data.authRequired === true;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### Example:
 * ```js
 * // This matches a transition that is exiting `parent.child`
 * var match = {
 *   exiting: 'parent.child'
 * }
 * ```
