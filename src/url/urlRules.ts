   * Defines the initial state, path, or behavior to use when the app starts.

   * This rule defines the initial/starting state for the application.

   * This rule is triggered the first time the URL is checked (when the app initially loads).
   * The rule is triggered only when the url matches either `""` or `"/"`.
   *

   * #### Example:
   * Start app at `home` state.
   * ```js
   * .initial({ state: 'home' });
   * ```
   *
   * #### Example:
   * Start app at `/home` (by url)

   * - a `string`: The string is compiled to a [[UrlMatcher]]
   * - a `RegExp`: The regexp is used to match the url.

   *
   * - a string: The url is redirected to the value of the string.
   * - a function: The url is redirected to the return value of the function.
   *
   * ---
   *
   * When the `handler` is a `string` and the `matcher` is a `UrlMatcher` (or string), the redirect
   * string is interpolated with parameter values.

   * #### Example:
   * When the URL is `/foo/123` the rule will redirect to `/bar/123`.

   *
   * ---

   * ```js
   * .when(new RegExp("^/foo/(.*)$"), "/bar/$1");

   * The "matched value" differs based on the `matcher`.
   * For [[UrlMatcher]]s, it will be the matched state params.
   * For `RegExp`, it will be the match array from `regexp.exec()`.
   *
   * If the handler returns a string, the URL is redirected to the string.

   * #### Example:
   * When the URL is `/foo/123` the rule will redirect to `/bar/123`.
   * ```js
   * .when(new RegExp("^/foo/(.*)$"), match => "/bar/" + match[1]);
