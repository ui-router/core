  /**
   * Resolve - a mechanism to asynchronously fetch data, participating in the Transition lifecycle
   *
   * The `resolve:` property defines data (or other dependencies) to be fetched asynchronously when the state is being entered.
   * After the data is fetched, it may be used in views, transition hooks or other resolves that belong to this state.
   * The data may also be used in any views or resolves that belong to nested states.
   *
   * ### As an array
   *
   * Each array element should be a [[ResolvableLiteral]] object.
   *
   * #### Example:
   * The `user` resolve injects the current `Transition` and the `UserService` (using its token, which is a string).
   * The [[ResolvableLiteral.resolvePolicy]] sets how the resolve is processed.
   * The `user` data, fetched asynchronously, can then be used in a view.
   * ```js
   * var state = {
   *   name: 'user',
   *   url: '/user/:userId
   *   resolve: [
   *     {
   *       token: 'user',
   *       policy: { when: 'EAGER' },
   *       deps: ['UserService', Transition],
   *       resolveFn: (userSvc, trans) => userSvc.fetchUser(trans.params().userId) },
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Note: an Angular 2 style [`useFactory` provider literal](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/dependency-injection.html#!#provide)
   * may also be used.  See [[ProviderLike]].
   * #### Example:
   * ```
   * resolve: [
   *   { provide: 'token', useFactory: (http) => http.get('/'), deps: [ Http ] },
   * ]
   * ```
   *
   * ### As an object
   *
   * The `resolve` property may be an object where:
   * - Each key (string) is the name of the dependency.
   * - Each value (function) is an injectable function which returns the dependency, or a promise for the dependency.
   *
   * This style is based on AngularJS injectable functions, but can be used with any UI-Router implementation.
   * If your code will be minified, the function should be ["annotated" in the AngularJS manner](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di#dependency-annotation).
   *
   * #### AngularJS Example:
   * ```js
   * resolve: {
   *   // If you inject `myStateDependency` into a controller, you'll get "abc"
   *   myStateDependency: function() {
   *     return "abc";
   *   },
   *   // Dependencies are annotated in "Inline Array Annotation"
   *   myAsyncData: ['$http', '$transition$' function($http, $transition$) {
   *     // Return a promise (async) for the data
   *     return $http.get("/foos/" + $transition$.params().foo);
   *   }]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Note: You cannot specify a policy for each Resolvable, nor can you use non-string
   * tokens when using the object style `resolve:` block.
   *
   * ### Lifecycle
   *
   * Since a resolve function can return a promise, the router will delay entering the state until the promises are ready.
   * If any of the promises are rejected, the Transition is aborted with an Error.
   *
   * By default, resolves for a state are fetched just before that state is entered.
   * Note that only states which are being *entered* during the `Transition` have their resolves fetched.
   * States that are "retained" do not have their resolves re-fetched.
   *
   * If you are currently in a parent state `parent` and are transitioning to a child state `parent.child`, the
   * previously resolved data for state `parent` can be injected into `parent.child` without delay.
   *
   * Any resolved data for `parent.child` is retained until `parent.child` is exited, e.g., by transitioning back to the `parent` state.
   *
   * Because of this scoping and lifecycle, resolves are a great place to fetch your application's primary data.
   *
   * ### Injecting resolves into other things
   *
   * During a transition, Resolve data can be injected into:
   *
   * - Views (the components which fill a `ui-view` tag)
   * - Transition Hooks
   * - Other resolves (a resolve may depend on asynchronous data from a different resolve)
   *
   * ### Injecting other things into resolves
   *
   * Resolve functions usually have dependencies on some other API(s).
   * The dependencies are usually declared and injected into the resolve function.
   * A common pattern is to inject a custom service such as `UserService`.
   * The resolve then delegates to a service method, such as `UserService.list()`;
   *
   * #### Special injectable tokens
   *
   * - `UIRouter`: The [[UIRouter]] instance which has references to all the UI-Router services.
   * - `Transition`: The current [[Transition]] object; information and API about the current transition, such as
   *    "to" and "from" State Parameters and transition options.
   * - `'$transition$'`: A string alias for the `Transition` injectable
   * - `'$state$'`: For `onEnter`/`onExit`/`onRetain`, the state being entered/exited/retained.
   * - Other resolve tokens: A resolve can depend on another resolve, either from the same state, or from any parent state.
   *
   * #### Example:
   * ```js
   * // Injecting a resolve into another resolve
   * resolve: [
   *   // Define a resolve 'allusers' which delegates to the UserService.list()
   *   // which returns a promise (async) for all the users
   *   { provide: 'allusers', useFactory: (UserService) => UserService.list(), deps: [UserService] },
   *
   *   // Define a resolve 'user' which depends on the allusers resolve.
   *   // This resolve function is not called until 'allusers' is ready.
   *   { provide: 'user', (allusers, trans) => _.find(allusers, trans.params().userId, deps: ['allusers', Transition] }
   * }
   * ```

  /**
   * A function used to lazy load code
   *
   * The `lazyLoad` function is invoked before the state is activated.
   * The transition waits while the code is loading.
   *
   * The function should load the code that is required to activate the state.
   * For example, it may load a component class, or some service code.
   * The function must return a promise which resolves when loading is complete.
   *
   * For example, this code lazy loads a service before the `abc` state is activated:
   *
   * ```
   * .state('abc', {
   *   lazyLoad: (transition, state) => System.import('./abcService')

   *
   * The `abcService` file is imported and loaded
   * (it is assumed that the `abcService` file knows how to register itself as a service).
   *
   * #### Lifecycle
   *
   * - The `lazyLoad` function is invoked if a transition is going to enter the state.
   * - The function is invoked before the transition starts (using an `onBefore` transition hook).
   * - The function is only invoked once; while the `lazyLoad` function is loading code, it will not be invoked again.
   *   For example, if the user double clicks a ui-sref, `lazyLoad` is only invoked once even though there were two transition attempts.
   *   Instead, the existing lazy load promise is re-used.
   * - When the promise resolves successfully, the `lazyLoad` property is deleted from the state declaration.
   * - If the promise resolves to a [[LazyLoadResult]] which has an array of `states`, those states are registered.
   * - The original transition is retried (this time without the `lazyLoad` property present).
   *
   * - If the `lazyLoad` function fails, then the transition also fails.
   *   The failed transition (and the `lazyLoad` function) could potentially be retried by the user.
   *
   * ### Lazy loading state definitions (Future States)
   *
   * State definitions can also be lazy loaded.
   * This might be desirable when building large, multi-module applications.
   *
   * To lazy load state definitions, a Future State should be registered as a placeholder.
   * When the state definitions are lazy loaded, the Future State is deregistered.
   *
   * A future state can act as a placeholder for a single state, or for an entire module of states and substates.
   * A future state should have:
   *
   * - A `name` which ends in `.**`.
   *   A future state's `name` property acts as a wildcard [[Glob]].
   *   It matches any state name that starts with the `name` (including child states that are not yet loaded).
   * - A `url` prefix.
   *   A future state's `url` property acts as a wildcard.
   *   UI-Router matches all paths that begin with the `url`.
   *   It effectively appends `.*` to the internal regular expression.
   *   When the prefix matches, the future state will begin loading.
   * - A `lazyLoad` function.
   *   This function should should return a Promise to lazy load the code for one or more [[StateDeclaration]] objects.
   *   It should return a [[LazyLoadResult]].
   *   Generally, one of the lazy loaded states should have the same name as the future state.
   *   The new state will then **replace the future state placeholder** in the registry.
   *
   * ### Additional resources
   *
   * For in depth information on lazy loading and Future States, see the [Lazy Loading Guide](https://ui-router.github.io/guides/lazyload).
   *
   * #### Example: states.js
   * ```js
   *
   * // This child state is a lazy loaded future state
   * // The `lazyLoad` function loads the final state definition
   * {
   *   name: 'parent.**',
   *   url: '/parent',
   *   lazyLoad: () => System.import('./lazy.states.js')
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * #### Example: lazy.states.js
   *
   * This file is lazy loaded.  It exports an array of states.
   *
   * ```js
   * import {ChildComponent} from "./child.component.js";
   * import {ParentComponent} from "./parent.component.js";
   *
   * // This fully defined state replaces the future state
   * let parentState = {
   *   // the name should match the future state
   *   name: 'parent',
   *   url: '/parent/:parentId',
